CharacterGuide/29┃Leon is ready to make quite the splash. \nLeon likes to fight in the water. Human Torpedo (Passive) causes his basic attacks to deal extra true damage and increases his movement and attack speed when he's on one of his pools. \nWaterway (Q) quickly shoots a straight trail of water that deals damage to enemies hit and creates him some of those pools he loves so much.\nCannonball (W) shields him (or a friend), and gives him some extra damage. Dealing damage with one of these extra strength attacks creates a pool near his enemy. Stand on that for some buffs or escape with his Duck Dive (E). He's slippery when wet. \nSpeaking of Duck Dive (E), Leon can use it to pop out of any pool of his choosing. When he pops out of it, he does damage and knocks up his enemies. He can use it to go over walls, too! He must've been practicing his butterfly stroke.\nWith Surf's Up (R), Leon rides a sick wave and gets pitted, sweeping away enemies in his path. Enemies are knocked back until the wave dissipates, and enemies that hit a wall are slowed and take damage. \nLeon doesn't want to get out of the pool, he's much stronger in them. He can create pools with both Waterway(Q) and Cannonball (W) to position himself strategically (or run) with Duck Dive(E). Combining all of these with Surf's Up (R) will surely make his opponents feel underwater.
CharacterGuide/29/Glove┃<color=orange>Gloves</color> often boast quick attack speed, allowing Leon to create pools quicker with his Cannonball. Couple that with Uppercut, and things start to look good for the waterbug.

CharacterGuide/2┃Aya is a long-distance character that requires different strategies depending on the weapon she has. Steady Shot (W) is a powerful skill, but it is hard to hit the enemy as you cannot change directions while using it. However, it is good when paired with Blank Cartridge (R), which makes the enemy stop. You can then suppress the enemy or shake them off by shooting in their direction while walking backwards.
CharacterGuide/2/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. The pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increases the movement speed of the user for a moment while reloading ammo.
CharacterGuide/2/SniperRifle┃<color=orange>Sniper</color>s require good use of surveillance cameras and traps in order to take advantage of the vision range and long distance of the Sniper Rifles. If Aya succeeds in predicting her enemy's movements, she can hit them at a very long distance with the Sniper skill, Ballistic Advantage.
CharacterGuide/2/AssaultRifle┃<color=orange>Assault Rifles</color> most important feature is that their basic attack fires 3 round bursts. Your movement will be restricted for the 3 round bursts. Remember to activate the weapon skill for even MORE damage!

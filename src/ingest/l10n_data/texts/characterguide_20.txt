CharacterGuide/20┃Lenox uses her whip to face enemies from any distance she pleases. With Recoil(Q), she can deal more damage to enemies that she puts space between. With Snakebite (W), she can damage enemies near her in a circle, slowing them, or attack enemies from afar, silencing them and increases her own movement speed. With Whiplash (E), she can push or pull enemies, allowing her to take full advantage of her Recoil (Q) and Snakebite (W). Enemies hit with Blue Viper (R) take damage when they move, meaning they either have to stand and face Lenox, or run and take damage. Lenox enjoys fishing - but when a fight breaks out, she'll be ready stop her enemies from moving. She ain't afraid to break their kneecaps, either.

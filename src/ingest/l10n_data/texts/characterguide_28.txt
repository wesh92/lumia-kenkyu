CharacterGuide/28┃Sua is a melee caster/brawler hybrid. Her passive, Bookworm, replaces her basic attack with a special, accelerated, skill damage version after using a skill. She can hold onto these special basic attacks, and using one reduces ALL of her ability cooldowns.\nSua can stop enemies from attacking her and to allow her to output her own damage instead. Odyssey (Q) is a long ranged ability that can be used to initiate fights. Hitting an enemy with any part of it places a Bookmark on them, and landing Odyssey on an enemy that has a Bookmark deals extra damage. The center strip of the ability stuns, which can be the perfect opportunity to follow up with Don Quixote (E). Bookmarked enemies take more damage from Don Quixote and are knocked airborne instead of being slowed. Don Quixote can also cover significant distance quickly, perfect for making a great escape.\nThe Curious Case (W) has two functions. When cast on an enemy, it blinds them, causing their auto attacks to miss. When cast on an ally or on yourself, it grants a shield, making you or your ally unstoppable, preventing a lot of CC! Well-timed usage of The Curious Case can make a world difference!\nSua's ultimate, Memory (R), recasts a stronger version of the spell she used. Memory of Odyssey is great for locking people down, Memory of Don Quixote can cover even greater distance to escape or run down enemies, and Memory of The Curious Case can prevent even more damage from enemies!\n...Now to find where I put my Lumia Library card... maybe she'll lend me some of Aesop's Fables\n

CharacterGuide/21┃Rozzi attacks enemies with flashy and quick movements. Her Passive, Dual Wield, allows her to use her basic attack twice, plus she gets some tasty extra recovery when she eats or drinks things made out of chocolate. \nEasy Shot (Q) is her main skill. Rozzi fires a skillshot. If she hits an enemy, her next movement command becomes a quick dash. \nFlutter(W) reduces the defense of enemies and hinders their HP recovery. It also reloads her ammo, so she can continue the barrage even when she's short on bullets. \nGun Vault (E) allows Rozzi to avoid getting targeted and taking damage, all while putting space between her and her enemy. She can use the skill again to push an enemy back, creating even more distance!\nRozzi can slow enemies by attaching her Semtex Bomb Mk-II (R) to them. If the bomb is attached, it's high time to attack her enemy and make it explode sooner.\nRozzi likes to stay at a distance, but because her skills have a short range, she has to get close and move quick to dodge attacks and secure kills. Her outplay potential is high and her flashy-ness is even higher; let's see what you can do.

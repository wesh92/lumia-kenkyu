CharacterGuide/26┃Barbara is a versatile character that fights alongside her Sentry Gun. She has separate sets of basic and enhanced skills. Retrofit (Passive) enhances her Sentry Gun and increases her attack speed every time Sentry Gun is hit by one of her skills. BT Sentry Gun Mk.II (Q) summons a Sentry Gun that automatically targets and deals damage to enemies. Free-Electron Laser (W) deals damage to enemies shot and slows them. If Barbara shoots a Sentry Gun with Free-Electron Laser, the Sentry Gun will fire an extra laser at an enemy. Barbara can create a Magnetic Cyclone (E) around her, which increases her movement speed and deals damage over time to enemies in a radius. If Magnetic Cyclone damages an enemy, Barbara will gain a shield depending on the damage dealt. Barbara can reactivate Magnetic Cyclone to slow enemies hit by both cyclones. Overclock (R) enhances all of Barbara's basic skills, transforming them into Short Circuit (Q), Photon Resonance (W), and Particle Storm (E). Short Circuit (Q) creates a new Sentry Gun that allows you to teleport to its location, Photon Resonance (W) is a ramped up version of Free-Electron Laser (W), and Particle Storm (E) is a larger version of Magnetic Cyclone and slows enemies hit by only one Particle Storm. Barbara's new tech ain't nothin' to mess with.

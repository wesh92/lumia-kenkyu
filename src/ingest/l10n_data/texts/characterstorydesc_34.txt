CharacterStoryDesc/34â”ƒA nomadic photographer, Nathapon wanders from place to place, rarely staying for long. He doesn't seem to remember a single thing.\n\nHe is often quickly accepted into new places and cultures he visits, thanks in part to his over optimism and sociability. Nathapon is very reluctant to form deep, lasting relationships with people so not many can remember him.\n\nSometimes he wakes up suddenly, searching for his camera frenetically. For him, the camera isn't only for saving memories but also for checking if he's forgotten any of his own. \n\nOccasionally, he hears unfamiliar voices calling his name.

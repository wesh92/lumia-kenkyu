CharacterGuide/16┃Silvia has different skills depending on if she's walking or on her motorcycle. She can ride her motorcycle once she reaches level 6 and has enough fuel. While not on the bike, she receives fuel passively, when she hits enemies, or moves to new zones. She cannot use basic attacks or weapon skills while riding her bike, but her movement speed increases. Driving in the same direction gradually increases her movement speed -- changing direction slows her down. Lumia Grand Prix (Passive) permanently increases her attack speed and skill amplification each time she enters a new zone. If she visits all 15 zones, she gains attack speed and skill amplification. \nWhen she's not on her bike, her skills revolve mainly around keeping her enemies at a distance by slowing them down or knocking them back. Radar Gun (Q) heals her allies and launching the Spare Tire (E) further away deals more damage. \nThe skills on her bike focus on getting close to her enemies. She can knock them airborne with Front Flip (W) or knock them back with Wheelie (E). \nSilvia can win in both up close and at a distance if she uses her skills right. She can get stronger by riding her motorcycle and travelling around Lumia when her fuel is full, allowing her to take the checkered flag.

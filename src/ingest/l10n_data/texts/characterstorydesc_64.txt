CharacterStoryDesc/64â”ƒA girl who sees the world through a fantasy window. Born with a congenital disability, Vanya has had the ability to see fantasies since childhood.\n\nUnlike her stifling reality, her fantasies were freeing, and at some point she came to rely on them more than reality. She doesn't get into trouble with the other test subjects, but it's not because she's mild-mannered, it's because she doesn't feel attached to reality.\n\nWhen Vanya stares into thin air, and butterflies flock to her, it indicates that she is seeing a fantasy.

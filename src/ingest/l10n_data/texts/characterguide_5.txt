CharacterGuide/5┃\nWhen Zahir hits an enemy with one of his skills, it applies an Eye of Azrael (passive) indicator to them. There are specific Eye of Azrael effects for each skills, so when hitting an enemy that has the Eye of Azrael indicator, you will have enhanced combat potential thanks to the additional effects.\nZahir's skills are mostly skill shots, so it can be hard to hit the enemy. To make things easier, hit them first with Vayvayastra (E) to knock them airborne and then use Narayanastra (Q) or Gandiva (W). You have to acquire Chakrams to use Gandiva (W), but the cooldown is rather short, so you can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time.\nHis ultimate, Bhargavastra (R), is a powerful attack in a certain range, so it is more effective when used with a debuff that prevents them from exiting that range.

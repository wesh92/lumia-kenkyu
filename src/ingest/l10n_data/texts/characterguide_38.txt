CharacterGuide/38┃Jenny swaps between her 2 roles: Red Wine is the top star that she always dreamed she would be, and Black Tea is her true self. Jenny gains Rehearsal when using basic attacks or landing Spotlight (Q). She also gains special effects through Rehearsal as well!\nPay attention to <color=#ffffff>Persona (E)</color>, which lets Jenny swap between her mobility-focused Black Tea role and combat-focused Red Wine role. She also performs a forward dash. Basic attacks reduce the cooldown of Persona (E), and deals extra skill damage for every 4th basic attack.\n<color=#ffffff>Play Dead(P)</color> gives Jenny a second wind. If Jenny’s health is depleted when she has enough Rehearsal, she hides herself in the shadows and reappears, dealing damage to enemies around her.\n<color=#ffffff>Spotlight (Q)</color> shines on the targeted location with spotlights, and Jenny receives buffs if she is under it.\n<color=#ffffff>Red Carpet(W)</color> rolls out a red carpet, pushing or pulling her enemies based on her current role.\n<color=#ffffff>Acceptance Speech (R)</color> creates an award stage slowing enemies that step on it. When it disappears, it deals damage and charms enemies.\nJenny’s area control and high mobility makes up for her short range, plus her ability to Play Dead allows her to take risky opportunities where other characters wouldn't be able to survive!
CharacterGuide/38/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. The pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increases the movement speed of the user for a moment while reloading ammo.

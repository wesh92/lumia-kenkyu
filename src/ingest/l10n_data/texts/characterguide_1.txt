CharacterGuide/1┃Jackie's tactic is her Continuity of Choices. The ideal situation is to activate her Hack & Slash(Q) skill first. You can then deal extra damage to the enemies that are bleeding and recover HP from the lifesteal effect by using Adrenaline Burst (W). Use Leaping Strike (E) to make your enemies move slower right after Adrenaline Burst. You can also reduce the distance between you and the enemy by combining Adrenaline Burst and Leaping Strike.
CharacterGuide/1/OneHandSword┃<color=orange>Daggers</color> are powerful for instant attacks. You can disappear for a moment and reappear again with the Cloak and Dagger skill to deal cellular damage.
CharacterGuide/1/TwoHandSword┃<color=orange>Two-handed Swords</color> are weaker than other weapons in the first half of the match but get really powerful in the second half. The weapon skill Parry can block the enemy's main attack once, so it becomes even scarier in the second half.
CharacterGuide/1/Axe┃<color=orange>Axes</color> are stronger in the earlier stages of the game. The weapon skill, Maleficent Helix, allows you to deal extra damage and heal after getting stacks from basic attacks.
CharacterGuide/1/DualSword┃<color=orange>Dual Swords</color> are kind of hidden weapons. You cannot choose them from the start - you have to make twin swords first, using a kitchen knife and a longsword. The specialty of having two swords is being able to perform fast attacks, and although their attack power is low, they are most effective when paired with the Dual Sword Rampage weapon skill and Adrenaline Burst (W), which maximize the life steal effect.

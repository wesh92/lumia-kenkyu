CharacterGuide/33┃Nicky prefers to slam into enemies super fast and show off her close combat prowess. \n<color=#ffffff>Short Tempered (Passive)</color> is the core of Nicky's kit, which converts damage taken by other characters into <color=red>Rage</color>. When her rage meter is full, she becomes <color=yellow>Enraged</color> for a period of time, allowing her basic attacks and skills to deal extra damage to nearby enemies. Enraged ends when her rage meter is depleted, and she will not be able to refill her Rage for a short time.\nNicky can catch up to enemies quickly by using <color=#ffffff>Slugfest(Q)</color> and then fill up her Rage by using <color=#ffffff>Body Blow(Q2)</color>.\nShe can block enemy attacks with <color=#ffffff>Guard & Reverse(W)</color>. If she successfully blocks the attack, Nicky's rage meter will be fully charged. She reverses by rushing forward, dealing damage to enemies and rooting them.\nNicky can throw a <color=#ffffff>Knockout Punch(E)</color> in front of her, dealing damage and slowing enemies. While Enraged, Nicky can use <color=#ffffff>Fury Jab!!(Enhanced E)</color> instead, which deals enhanced damage and stuns enemies. They don't even share a cooldown!\nFinally, <color=#ffffff>Pure Rage Uppercut!!(R)</color> is Nicky's powerful ultimate that can be only used when Nicky is Enraged. She dashes to the targeted enemy player and uppercuts them, dealing massive damage and knocking them airborne. Enraged immediately ends and Nicky lands slightly before the enemy, which gives her some time to follow up with additional offense. \nNicky's main strategy is to take advantage of Short Tempered by balancing her rage meter between basic attacks and skills.

CharacterGuide/25┃Bernice specializes in marking and tracking his beasts.\nBuckshot (Passive) is short range but it fires multiple bullets at the same time, giving Bernice destructive force in close range and allowing him to deal damage to multiple enemies.\nLeg Shot (Q) fires a sharp-edged bullet, reducing the movement speed of enemies hit. If your enemy is rooted, like with a Foothold Trap or an Explosive Bola, they take even more damage. Foothold Trap (W) roots enemies that step on it and makes them bleed. Falconry (E) has a good passive and active. The passive marks enemies that are rooted by Foothold Trap (W). Activating Falconry gives him better vision and marks nearby enemies. Marked enemies are more visible to Bernice and he moves faster towards them. Hitting the marked baddies with a basic attack reduces the cooldown of Leg Shot and Explosive Bola. Explosive Bola (R) roots and deals damage to enemies hit. After the root, the bola explodes, dealing damage to the enemy and spreads to other enemies nearby, rooting them as well. Working around Foothold Trap (W) is a favorable play for Bernice. He can get close to enemies and deal big damage with Buckshot by moving super fast towards them. Use Explosive Bola to root your target and then smack them with Leg Shot to get that extra damage. You can't run but you can't hide from Bernice.

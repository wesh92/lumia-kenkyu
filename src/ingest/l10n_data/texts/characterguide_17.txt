CharacterGuide/17┃Adriana is a control mage who uses long-ranged skills and leaves burning areas on the map.\nWith Pyromaniac (Passive), Adriana deals damage over time to enemies inside burning areas and recovers SP.\nThrow flames in a specific direction with Flamethrower (Q), dealing damage to enemies, and allowing you to keep fighting while maintaining distance.\nOil Slick (W) is Adriana's key skill. You can use the skill twice to create oil slicks. Enemies in oil slicks have their movement speed reduced and are unable to use any movement skill, allowing you to ground them in one location. You can also light on fire the oil slicks to create a burning area and deal damage over time.\nAs Adriana can charge in the targeted direction with Fire Escape (E), this skill is even more efficient when used with Oil Slick (W) to juke your enemies or chase them while also creating burning areas.\nAdriana can use Cocktail Party (R) up to 3 times to create burning areas and knock back enemies.\nShe excels at dealing continuous damage and easily controlling small areas like the last restricted area (safe zone).\nTake advantage of her long-ranged attacks and control the map to your advantage, and soon you'll be dominating the whole island with Adriana's fireworks.

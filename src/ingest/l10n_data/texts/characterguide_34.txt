CharacterGuide/34┃Nathapon uses his strong crowd control to keep enemies in his consistent damage.\nSlow Shutter(Passive) has two effects. First, his camera’s attack speed is fixed but his basic attacks deal extra skill damage. Second, he can create an invisible Trail Camera with a Branch and a Surveillance Camera.\nSnapshot(Q) has both a passive and an active effect. \nSnapshot's passive enables Nathapon to apply Picturesque to enemies when dealing damage. Picturesque can be stacked up to 3 times, with each stack increasing Nathapon's damage. Enemies lose all stacks of Picturesque when they leave Nathapon's vision range.\nSnapshot(Active) lets Nathapon snap a photograph of the targeted area, dealing damage. Enemies with max stacks of Picturesque are slowed.\nTimelapse(W) deals damage over time and slows enemies in range. The final frame of the timelapse deals extra damage and roots enemies.\nPanorama(E) lets Nathapon take a photo with his telephoto lens in the targeted direction. Although this skill is precise, catching the enemy successfully will leave a mark in an area. After a moment, the captured enemy will be knocked back towards the mark.\nNathapon's ultimate, F-Stop(R), lets him snap a photo of everything in the targeted area. All photographed enemies are put into stasis, unable to perform any action, and gain 3 stacks of Picturesque.\nThe key to outplaying your opponents with Nathapon is vision range and accurate timing. Be careful of blind spots that the enemy can disappear into!

CharacterGuide/32┃William, Lumia's Ace Pitcher, is ready to throw some curveballs! He pegs his enemies with baseballs and can pick up balls that bounce off them to get an upper hand in battles.\n\nWith No Hitter(Passive), William's basic attacks cause a ball to bounce off enemies. When he walks towards one, his movement speed is increased and picking it up will cause his next basic attack to deal extra damage. No Hitter will stack up to 3, allowing him to use Fastball(Q) when fully stacked. 3 strikes and they're out, am I right?\n\nFastball(Q) gives him an attack speed boost and he'll throw an additional ball at enemies to deal extra damage.\n\nWindup(W) allows William to create a pitcher's mound around him that knocks enemies back, and pitches a baseball that returns to him, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Enemies that are hit by the ball both on the way out and on the way back are stunned. While standing on the mound, William's attack range is increased and No Hitter balls will return to him.\n\nSliding Catch(E) will let William slide to the targeted baseball. When he picks up a baseball, William's defense is increased for a short time.\n\nWith Signature Fireball(R), William leaps into the air and throws his signature fireball to the targeted area, dealing damage and slowing enemies. Four balls bounce out from the center after impact.\n\nWilliam can pick up the baseballs to increase his power or use sliding catch to keep his enemies on their toes. Make quick decisions with your baseballs - don't always give into the temptation to slide to one of them!\n\nWilliam's repertoire of pitches are what makes him the Ace Pitcher and will lead him to a perfect game!
CharacterGuide/32/HighAngleFire┃<color=orange>Throw</color> weapons go well with William, who likes to sling out basic attacks. Smokescreen, the weapon skill, reduces the enemy's vision and movement speed, giving William some defensive options but can also allow him to be a little aggressive with it.

CharacterGuide/4┃Magnus' main attack is 17 vs 1 (W). In order to maximize the effectiveness of this skill, you need to hit the opponent with Broken Bullet (Q), reducing their speed. Thanks to Tough Body (passive), Magnus also gets scarier every time he loses HP, making the 17 vs 1 (W) skill even stronger as it also increases his defense power. His ultimate, Bike From Hell, is a skill used for long-distance engagements, making it good for finishing off escaping enemies.
CharacterGuide/4/Hammer┃<color=orange>Hammers</color> are weapons with strong attack power. The Armor Piercing weapon skill has a defense power reduction effect, so you can quickly suppress enemies with low defense power.
CharacterGuide/4/Bat┃<color=orange>Bats</color> have an advantage by being faster. By using the Full Swing skill, you can stun the enemy - by using it with Heavy Strike (E), Magnus can become very scary when fighting against an enemy between four walls.

CharacterGuide/14┃Chiara is a versatile character capable of both offensive and defensive playstyles. \n\nMania (E) throws out a tether that latches onto the first target it hits. Maintaining this tether restricts their movement. This allows you to stick to your enemies or escape from difficult situations.\n\nDepraved Prayer (W) gives a shield that temporarily increases Chiara's HP. Depraved Prayer may also be used right before a fight so that it may be reactivated to deal damage immediately.\n\nHand of Corruption (Q) can be used in a cone-shaped form or charged to shoot in a line. Try to utilize Hand of Corruption to slow an enemy, making it easier to hit Mania (E), or to get away from an enemy.\n\nStigma (Passive) reduces the defense of enemies for each stack applied. Every time that she hits an enemy with a skill, it applies a stack of Stigma, up to four. In conjunction with the skill damage applied from Plague (R), Chiara can reduce the defense of multiple enemies at once. At four stacks of Stigma, she also gains movement speed.\n\nPlague (R) causes Chiara's basic attacks to become temporarily ranged. Enemies inside of Plague's area of effect take skill damage every second, applying Stigma. In addition, when a player or animal has four stacks of Stigma on them, Chiara gains vision of them and may recast her R to end Plague and descend upon them dealing massive damage. A good usage of this is to close distance on a fleeing target. If the recast kills the target, the cooldown of Chiara's ultimate is reduced by 50%. \n\nChiara is at her strongest while using Plague. Enemies will run from her while she has it active! Be careful deciding when you want to use Plague, knowing when to go all-in is a skill best learned through experience. Now go and make the sinners of Lumia Island repent for their transgressions!\n\n

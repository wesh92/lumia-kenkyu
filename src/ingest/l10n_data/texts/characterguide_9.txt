CharacterGuide/9┃Isol excels at controlling the battlefield. The key to his playstyle is utilizing his MOK Operational Mines(R) to either expand your awareness and influence your enemies' movements or concentrate your area control into one lethal deathtrap.\n\nIsol's passive, Guerilla Warfare, enables impromptu placements of traps and reduces the defense of people that take damage from them, so expect your opponents to have detection and disarming drones. As time ticks down and the final zones approach, prepare yourself for a battle of resources and attrition.\n\nThere are two primary ways Isol goes on the offensive. Guerilla Warfare's defensive debuff applies to MOK Operational Mines, allowing Isol to tear through enemies if he focuses on his basic attacks. Alternatively, you can get items that lower your skill cooldowns increase the number of MOK Operational Mines you can have in a pile. Pairing a stack of MOK Mines with a movement-impairing trap makes for a cruel and effective ambush.\n\nAs destructive as Isol's MOK assault can be, he shines with his excellent awareness and evasion. Isol's mobility skill, Camouflage(E), cloaks him instantly so you can run and hide from your pursuers or cost them a camera. Use Sentex Bomb(Q) to scout bushes, lure enemies with a fake alert, or latch it onto an enemy for damage and crowd control. Following up Sentex Bomb with Rebel Assault(W) run-and-gun slow is an effective combo to chase or attack on the move, but try not to chase too hard! Isol is utilized best when he fights on his own battlefield.
CharacterGuide/9/AssaultRifle┃The most important feature of<color=orange>Assault Rifles</color> is that their basic attack fires 3 round bursts. For the 3 round bursts to be efficient, your movement has to be a bit restrained, but it is great when paired with a Semtex Bomb (Q) that sticks to enemies. Activate the Overheat skill to pump out even more damage on top of the exploding Semtex Bomb!
CharacterGuide/9/Pistol┃<color=orange>Pistols</color> do not have a long range but they provide good survivability. Isol can also continuously kite by using Camouflage (E) and the pistol weapon skill, Moving Reload, increasing his movement speed.

CharacterGuide/37┃Daniel is an assassin who roams in the dark and quickly finishes wounded foes.\nDaniel’s passive <color=#ffffff>Recluse(P)</color>, lets him thrive in the darkness of the night. His vision penalty is reduced and his out of combat movement speed is increased. Also, his attack power increases as he loses HP regardless of the time of day.\nDaniel uses <color=#ffffff>Dusk Shears(Q)</color> to manifest ghastly scissors at the targeted location, dealing damage, slows enemies hit, and increases the attack speed of his next 3 basic attacks. Hitting an enemy with the middle of the blades deals extra damage and reduces the cooldown of <color=#ffffff>Dusk Shears(Q)</color> and <color=#ffffff>Shadow Glide(E)</color>.\nDaniel marks his target with <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color>, granting him 2m of vision around his target, and slowing himself for a few seconds. The <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color> mark reduces the target's vision range until damaged by Daniel and stores some of Daniel's damage dealt to the target. After a few seconds, Daniel becomes <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by his target, revealing them to Daniel. Daniel stays <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by the target for a few seconds. Damaging the <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> target consumes the mark, dealing the stored damage along with additional damage, and roots the target. Killing an enemy with the damage from the <color=#ffffff>Inspiration</color> mark resets its cooldown. Daniel becomes uninspired if the target moves too far away from him.\nDaniel uses his <color=#ffffff>Shadow Glide(E)</color> to duck into the shadows and dash in the targeted direction. His next basic attack teleports him behind his target, dealing additional damage.\n<color=#ffffff>Masterpiece(R)</color> lets Daniel become his target’s shadow if they have <color=#ffffff>Growing Inspiration</color>, if he is <color=#ffffff>Inspired</color> by them, or if they are <color=#ffffff>Rooted</color>. While Daniel is shadowing his target, he repeatedly deals cellular damage. Upon reaching the max duration or reactivating the skill, Daniel completes his masterpiece and leaves them behind, dealing damage based on his target’s missing HP.\nDaniel needs to time his assassination attempts well to be as deadly as possible. His damage output potential is high, but be careful not to commit too early - it might cause you to lose your own head!

CharacterGuide/13┃Collecting materials for not only equipment, but also for food and beverages, is very important for Xiukai because of his passive: Juggernaut Chef.\nWhen Xiukai makes food or drink, they have higher HP/SP, and will also increase his max HP (depending on rarity). While all of his skills cost HP, the more HP he has, the more damage he deals.\nXiukai's skills Heavy Meal (W), Wok It Off (E), and Burnt to a Crisp (R) apply extra damage and effects if the enemy has impaired movement, so it is important to combo those skills with Lost in the Sauce (Q).\nAfter using Lost in the Sauce (Q), try sliding to an enemy with Wok It Off (E) to knock them up. Use Heavy Meal (W) right after to slow them, and follow up with Burnt to a Crisp (R) to reduce their defense and deal a final blow. \nIf Xiukai continuously crafts food, he can have an extraordinarily high max HP level and easily take out his enemies to be the last survivor.

The weapon skill Shadow Stab has a push-back effect, in addition to the movement speed reduction effect, so you can maintain distance when fighting.
CharacterGuide/13/OneHandSword┃<color=orange>Daggers</color> are powerful for instant attacks. You can disappear for a moment and reappear again with the Cloak and Dagger skill to deal cellular damage.

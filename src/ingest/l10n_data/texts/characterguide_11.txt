CharacterGuide/11┃Yuki deals additional damage and gains skill damage reduction depending on the number of cufflinks he has, which means that you should carefully manage his cufflinks. Yuki gains one cufflink automatically every 4 seconds, to a maximum of 4. You can also fill up your cufflinks with Button Up (W). Having a cufflink when using From Head to Toe (Q) stuns the enemy, increasing your chances to hit them with Dashing Gentleman (E) right after. On the other hand, if you use Dashing Gentleman (E) during the cooldown of From Head to Toe (Q), you can deal immediate damage with From Head to Toe (Q) right after dealing damage with Dashing Gentleman (E).\nWhen you max out the skill points of both Dashing Gentleman (E) and Button Up (W), you can use Dashing Gentleman (E) again immediately after using Button Up (W), making it possible to do a skill combo E-W-E.\nHis ultimate Coup de Grace (R) is effective for finishing off enemies or reducing the distance between you and them as it attacks in a wide range and has movement speed reduction effects.
CharacterGuide/11/TwoHandSword┃<color=orange>Two-handed Swords</color> are weaker than other weapons in the first half of the match but get really powerful in the second half. The weapon skill Parry can block the enemy's main attack once, so it becomes even scarier in the second half.
CharacterGuide/11/DualSword┃<color=orange>Dual Swords</color> can be considered "hidden weapons". You cannot choose them from the start - you have to make twin swords first, using a kitchen knife and a longsword. They have a lower average base attack power, but are able to attack quickly and consecutively.

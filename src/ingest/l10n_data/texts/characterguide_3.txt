To gain stacks of Touché quickly, you need to use Attaque Composée (W) often, as it allows you to perform basic attacks twice in a row. You can deal extra damage to enemies with full stacks by using Fente (Q) or Marche & Rompre (E).\nToggle her ultimate, Garde (R), to deal extra damage. When toggled, each attack uses SP, so keep an eye on it!

CharacterGuide/3/TwoHandSword┃<color=orange>Two-hand Swords</color> are weaker than other weapons in the first half of the match but get really powerful in the second half. The weapon skill Parry can block the enemy's main attack once, so it becomes even scarier in the second half.
CharacterGuide/3/Spear┃<color=orange>Spears</color> are powerful in middle range, but you need to control your distance well as they are quite weak when fighting close range. The weapon skill Shadow Stab has a knockback effect, in addition to movement speed reduction, so you can maintain distance when fighting.

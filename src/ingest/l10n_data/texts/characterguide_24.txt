CharacterGuide/24┃Adela treats her opponents as her pawns. Her passive, Control the Center gives her longer range than other rapier wielders, at the cost of her inability to increase her attack speed. Attack speed is converted to attack power. Promotion (Q) allows Adela to summon a actual pawn with a very short cooldown. Consecutive uses will summon a Queen, stunning enemies. Knight Fork (W) summons a Knight to attack her enemies, and can also manipulate her other pieces to deal additional damage and knock enemies airborne. Castling (E) uses the Rook to attack enemies and grant Adela the ability to switch positions with her rook. When Rook attacks, other pieces on the way also cause damage. Checkmate (R) causes Adela to rise into the air and make her untargetable. Upon landing, she deals damage to enemies nearby. Her pieces deal damage, too! Adela is great at staying at a distance and using her pieces to deal continuous damage to her enemies. It's also a good idea to attack from range to deal extra damage and increasing her movement speed so she can position herself better. When danger, use Casling or Checkmate to get out and reset the chess board. Show them the true grandmaster with Adela’s impressive tactics.

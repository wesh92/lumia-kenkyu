CharacterGuide/27┃Infiltration (Passive) hides Alex so enemies cannot see you outside of his detection radius starting from level 6. He also gains weapon mastery for all his weapon types evenly. EMP Barrage (R) is a long range, multipurpose skill that can help you snipe and slow faraway enemies. Depending on his held weapon type (Melee/Ranged), Alex's skills will have different effects. Gauss Pistol (Ranged Q) increases his attack power when he hits enemies. Recognition Signal (Ranged W) grants vision of enemies hit, and increases his range temporarily if there are enemies hit. Blowback (Ranged E) allows him to step backwards, hit enemies, and slow them. Alex will gain his infiltration invisibility after using it, allowing him to swap weapons - even in combat. Incursion (Melee Q) increases your attack power when you dash towards your target and deal damage. Dead Drop (Melee W) is a thrown projectile that explodes, pulling enemies to the center. Double Agent (Melee E) gives you time to swap your weapons by taunting enemies and creating a hologram clone. Alex is a character with a ton of insane playmaking potential - especially when taking advantage of his ability to swap weapons on the spy— erm, on the fly.

After dashing, she is granted vision of all enemies near her for a few seconds and her next basic attack is enhanced. If Eva lands a basic attack on a target that is affected by one of her crowd control effects, it applies Amethyst Duress, dealing extra damage over time and granting Eva vision of them.\n<color=#ffffff>VF Eruption(R) </color> releases Eva’s stored VF, dealing true damage continuously. A stack of VF Dissonance is applied each tick and deals additional damage at max stacks. \nVision control is crucial for Eva to get the high ground against her opponents.

CharacterGuide/36/HighAngleFire┃<color=orange>Throw</color> weapons are effective at a range, making them work well with Eva who likes to fight (and open boxes) from a distance. Smokescreen both slows and reduces vision which gives Eva extra survivability and opportunity to chain her skills together.

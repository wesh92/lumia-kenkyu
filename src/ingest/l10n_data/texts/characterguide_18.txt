CharacterGuide/18┃Use the short cooldowns of Shoichi's skills to expertly dodge enemy attacks and use his movement to deal with enemies.\nPhony Deal (Passive) increases Shoichi's critical strike chance as he hits enemies, and increases his basic attack damage when reaching 5 stacks. \nGood Faith (Q) is a unique skill. Hitting an enemy with it allows you to use Bad Faith, giving you increased range and a convenient dagger on the ground.\nBottom Line (W) is the main strength of Shoichi - his movement. Dash to an enemy or dagger and reset your Bottom Line cooldown if you pick up a dagger. \nWith Risky Business (E), Shoichi takes a step back and throws a dagger, leaving a dagger behind the enemy, making it a breeze to use Bottom Line (W) just after it.\nRuthless (R) deals AOE damage and leaves 4 daggers on the ground around him, making the terrain favorable to Shoichi.\nShoichi's skills can be connected easily thanks to his ability to leave daggers on the ground, and taking advantage of Phony Deal (Passive) will allow you to show your enemies the business. \nConnecting skills, precise control, and good judgement are keys to playing Shoichi efficiently.

CharacterGuide/30┃Eleven doubles as both a strong initiator and a fighter with incredible sustained damage potential.\nGround Beef (P) drops a slider on the ground after hitting consecutive autos. Eating it grants her some HP and the ability to activate any of her enhanced skills instantly.\nBurger Queen (Q) allows Eleven to deal damage and slow their enemies when it's enhanced. It is best used to continue chasing, as the slow will allow you to stick to your opponent for a longer period of time.\nFood For Thought (W) is an AOE CC ability that allows Eleven to both start and continue fights. It is best used after activating Calorie Cyclone to keep her opponents stuck inside of her raging food cyclone. Once they’re taunted, deal as much damage as possible!\nOn Air! (E) allows Eleven to run away - or to close the gap. It’s most potent when enhanced under the effects of a slider, as it lets her jump to any distance up to 12m without the need for any charge up! She can use this to catch opponents off guard and get on top of them, or to run away without the chance to stop her.\nCalorie Cyclone (R) will give Eleven an enhanced skill and greatly increase her damage. Once you are close to your opponent, pop this skill and start beating up your enemy with that massive fork of yours.\nAlso don't forget to cook up some #11 Combo Meals for you and your friends. They're delicious and really heal you!

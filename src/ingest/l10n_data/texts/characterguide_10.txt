CharacterGuide/10┃Li Dailin can use different strategies depending on how high her <color=yellow>BAC</color> is. \nDrink Up (W) temporarily boosts her basic attacks (Liquid Strength), while increasing her Blood Alcohol Content (BAC). If her BAC is above 40, Spirited Kick (Q), Bottom Shelf (E), Striking Tiger (R) reduce her BAC by a fixed amount, but she can deal a lot of damage when Tipsy is active. When consuming alcoholic drink items, she gets additional skill amplification and the duration of her Liquid Strength effect (increased basic attack damage) is extended. Consuming beverage items mid-fight is very effective.\nDrink Up (W) fills up your BAC, but be careful not to use it too often - Li Dailin cannot use her skills for a few seconds if she enters an Inebriated state. However, all her basic attacks are doubled while Inebriated state, so it might be useful when all your skills are in cooldown.
